# AI-Driven Development - 30-Day Challenge Task-3

## ​Task 3 – Official Submission

## **​PART A — Research Questions (Short Answers)**

​1. What new improvements were introduced in Gemini 3.0?

Gemini 3.0 is the smartest model. It has a new "Thinking" mode to solve hard math and logic problems by thinking like a human. 
It also has "Google Antigravity," a new tool that makes AI a partner in coding, not just a helper. 

​2. How does Gemini 3.0 improve coding & automation workflows?

It makes coding easy because the AI acts like an autonomous agent. It can plan work and fix errors by itself in many steps. With Google Antigravity, the AI can work in the editor and terminal automatically while the developer acts as an architect.

​3. How does Gemini 3.0 improve multimodal understanding?

Gemini 3.0 understands everything together. It mixes text, images, video, audio, and code to understand the deep meaning at once, instead of looking at them separately.

​4. Name any two developer tools introduced with Gemini 3.0.
Two tools introduced are:
​Google Antigravity
​Thinking parameter
